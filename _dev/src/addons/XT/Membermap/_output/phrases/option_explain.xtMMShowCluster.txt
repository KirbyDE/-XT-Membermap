The number on a cluster indicates how many markers it contains. Notice that as you zoom into any of the cluster locations, the number on the cluster decreases, and you begin to see the individual markers on the map. Zooming out of the map consolidates the markers into clusters again.<br>
<b>MaxZoom</b>: The maximum zoom level at which clustering is enabled or 0 if clustering is to be enabled at all zoom levels.<br>
<b>MinClusterSize</b>: The minimum number of markers needed in a cluster before the markers are hidden and a cluster marker appears.
